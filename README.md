This repository is for holding software and other project artifacts from the Aalto-University protopaja 2019 course
from project group 4. Everything here is under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, with two 
exceptions: The KiCAD Arduino board symbols and footprints which are licensed under LGPL under the name of 
Nicholas Parks Young at https://github.com/Alarm-Siren/arduino-kicad-library. The original readme can be found in 
the MegaShield folder.

The second exception is the software code, which is written under the MIT license, and is totally free for grabs.

NOTE: There is a current (01.09.2019) bug in the Windows Arduino AVR compiler, so the Arduino mega code might not compile
with the latest board definitions. This can be fixed by downgrading the board definitions from the boards manager. See:
