This repository is for holding software and other project artifacts from the Aalto-University protopaja 2019 course
from project group 4. Everything here is free to use under the MIT license, except the KiCAD Arduino board symbols and footprints,
which are licensed under LGPL under the name of Nicholas Parks Young at https://github.com/Alarm-Siren/arduino-kicad-library. The original readme can be found in the MegaShield folder.

NOTE: There is a current (01.09.2019) bug in the Windows Arduino AVR compiler, so the Arduino mega code might not compile
with the latest board definitions. This can be fixed by downgrading the board definitions from the boards manager. See:
